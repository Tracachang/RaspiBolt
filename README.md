Fork of Raspibolt guide by Stadicus. Using Manjaro ARM64 instead of Raspbian

Why am I forking Raspibolt and updating this guide?

Because I think Manjaro it is a great OS with a great repo, always updated, rolling release and very stable, the actual Raspibolt guide it is based on raspbian 32 bit which is deprecated and even if it is updated they will probabbly switch to Debian. I have enjoyed a lot using the Raspibolt and following this guide for Manajaro I've found somme issues/differences that I've solved and I would like to share for users interested in running their own node using Manjaro which is an Arch Linux based distribution.
